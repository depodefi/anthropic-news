      <title>Donating the Model Context Protocol and establishing the Agentic AI Foundation</title>
      <link>https://www.anthropic.com/news/donating-the-model-context-protocol-and-establishing-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation</link>
      <description>Today, we’re donating theModel Context Protocol(MCP) to the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), a directed fund under theLinux Foundation, co-founded by Anthropic, Block and OpenAI, with support from Google, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cloudflare, and Bloomberg. One year ago, weintroducedMCP as a universal, open standard for connecting AI applications to external systems. Since then, MCP has achieved incredible adoption: We’re continuing to invest in MCP’s growth. Claude now has a directory with over 75connectors(powered by MCP), and we recently launchedTool Search and Programmatic Tool Callingcapabilities in our API to help optimize production-scale MCP deployments, handling thousands of tools efficiently and reducing latency in complex agent workflows.MCP now has an official, community-drivenRegistryfor discovering available MCP servers, and theNovember 25thspec release introduced many new features, including asynchronous operations, statelessness, server identity, and official extensions. There are also official SDKs (Software Development Kits) for MCP in all major programming languages with 97M+ monthly SDK downloads across Python and TypeScript.Since its inception, we’ve been committed to ensuring MCP remains open-source, community-driven and vendor-neutral. Today, we further that commitment by donating MCP to the Linux Foundation. TheLinux Foundationis a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering the growth of sustainable, open-source ecosystems through neutral stewardship, community building, and shared infrastructure. It has decades of experience stewarding the most critical and globally-significant open-source projects, including The Linux Kernel, Kubernetes, Node.js, and PyTorch. Importantly, the Linux Foundation has a proven track record in facilitating open collaboration and maintaining vendor neutrality. The Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) is a directed fund under the Linux Foundation co-founded by Anthropic,BlockandOpenAI, with support fromGoogle,Microsoft,AWS,CloudflareandBloomberg. The AAIF aims to ensure agentic AI evolves transparently, collaboratively, and in the public interest through strategic investment, community building, and shared development of open standards. Anthropic is donating the Model Context Protocol to the Linux Foundation's new Agentic AI Foundation, where it will joingooseby Block andAGENTS.mdby OpenAI as founding projects. Bringing these and future projects under the AAIF will foster innovation across the agentic AI ecosystem and ensure these foundational technologies remain neutral, open, and community-driven.The Model Context Protocol’sgovernance modelwill remain unchanged: the project’s maintainers will continue to prioritize community input and transparent decision-making. Open-source software is essential for building a secure and innovative ecosystem for agentic AI. Today’s donation to the Linux Foundation demonstrates our commitment to ensuring MCP remains a neutral, open standard. We’re excited to continue contributing to MCP and other agentic AI projects through the AAIF.Learn more about MCP atmodelcontextprotocol.ioand get involved with the AAIFhere.</description>

      <title>Accenture and Anthropic launch multi-year partnership to move enterprises from AI pilots to production</title>
      <link>https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-accenture-partnership</link>
      <description>Anthropic and Accenture today announced a major expansion of their partnership to help enterprises move from AI pilots to full-scale deployment. Key elements of the announcement: The announcement comes as Anthropic's enterprise market share has grown from 24% to 40%*. &quot;AI is changing how almost everyone works, and enterprises need both cutting-edge AI and trusted expertise to deploy it at scale. Accenture brings deep enterprise transformation experience, and Anthropic brings the most capable models. Our new partnership means that tens of thousands of Accenture developers will be using Claude Code, making this our largest ever deployment—and the new Accenture Anthropic Business Group will help enterprise clients use our smartest AI models to make major productivity gains,” saidDario Amodei, CEO and co-founder of Anthropic. “This exciting expansion of our partnership with Anthropic will help our clients accelerate the shift from experimenting with AI to using it as a catalyst for reinvention across the enterprise,” saidJulie Sweet, Chair and CEO, Accenture. “With the powerful combination of Anthropic’s Claude capabilities and Accenture’s AI expertise and industry and function domain knowledge, organizations can embed AI everywhere responsibly and at speed—from software development to customer experience—to drive innovation, unlock new sources of growth and build their confidence to lead in the age of AI.” The new Accenture Anthropic Business Group makes Anthropic one of Accenture’s select strategic partners. Accenture Business Groups are dedicated practices built around Accenture’s most important technology partnerships. Each has its own teams, go-to-market focus, and specialized expertise, reflecting the depth of investment and long-term commitment involved. Approximately 30,000 Accenture professionals that will be trained on Claude, including forward deployed engineers (also known as “reinvention deployed engineers” at Accenture) who help embed Claude within client environments to scale enterprise AI adoption. This will comprise one of the largest ecosystems of Claude practitioners in the world. These teams combine Accenture's AI, industry, and function expertise—along with deep partnerships with leading cloud providers—with Anthropic's Claude models and Claude Code, plus its proven playbooks for regulated industries. For Accenture’s enterprise customers, this means faster deployment with less risk. Instead of building AI capabilities from scratch, companies can tap into a ready-made bench of Claude experts to move from pilot to production immediately. Accenture and Anthropic are launching a new joint offering designed for CIOs to measure value and drive large-scale AI adoption across their engineering organizations. This is the first product from the partnership, providing a structured path to shift how enterprise software is designed, built, and maintained. The offering puts Claude Code, which now holds over half* of the AI coding market, at the center of the enterprise software development lifecycle, combined with three Accenture capabilities: a framework to quantify real productivity gains and ROI, workflow redesign for AI-first development teams, and change management and training that keeps pace as AI evolves. This can help enterprises turn developer productivity gains into company-wide impact for customers through faster releases, shorter development cycles, and the ability to bring new products to market sooner. Claude Code accelerates developer productivity at every level. Junior developers produce senior-level code, completing integration tasks faster and onboarding in weeks instead of months. Senior developers shift to higher-value work, including architecture, validation, and strategic oversight. Accenture and Anthropic are jointly developing industry offerings with an initial focus on highly regulated industries—including financial services, life sciences, healthcare, and public sector—where organizations face the dual challenge of modernizing legacy systems while maintaining strict security and governance requirements. For example: The partnership is grounded in a shared commitment to responsible AI, combining Anthropic's constitutional AI principles with Accenture's AI governance expertise so that enterprises can use AI safely with confidence, transparency, and accountability. To support hands-on engagement with the world's largest enterprises, Accenture is bringing Claude into its network of Accenture Innovation Hubs. These hubs serve as centers for safe AI co-creation, enabling Global 2000 clients to prototype, test, and validate AI solutions in controlled environments before enterprise-wide deployment. This addresses a critical barrier to AI adoption at scale: the need for large organizations to experiment and learn without risking production systems or sensitive data. Anthropic and Accenture will also co-invest in a Claude Center of Excellence inside Accenture, creating a dedicated environment for the joint design of new AI offerings tailored to specific enterprise needs, industry requirements, and regulatory contexts. Accenture clients can contact their account team to discuss deployment options. Enterprises can visit ourEnterprise pageto learn more about Claude. Claude is the only frontier model available on all three of the world's most prominent cloud services, including Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, and Microsoft Azure. *Menlo Ventures’ 2025 State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report</description>

      <title>Snowflake and Anthropic announce $200 million partnership to bring agentic AI to global enterprises</title>
      <link>https://www.anthropic.com/news/snowflake-anthropic-expanded-partnership</link>
      <description>Today, we announce a significant expansion of our strategic partnership with Snowflake. The multi-year, $200 million agreement will not only make Anthropic’s Claude models available in the Snowflake platform to more than 12,600 global customers across Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, and Microsoft Azure, but also establishes a joint go-to-market (GTM) initiative focused on deploying AI agents across the world's largest enterprises. The partnership enables enterprises to gain insights from both structured and unstructured data using Claude, while maintaining rigorous security standards. Snowflake uses Claude widely for internal operations as well. Claude Code enhances developer productivity and innovation across Snowflake's engineering organization, while a Claude-powered GTM AI Assistant built onSnowflake Intelligenceenables sales teams to centralize data, ask questions in natural language, and find the answers that speed up deal cycles. Thousands of Snowflake customers already process trillions of Claude tokens per month throughSnowflake Cortex AI. The next phase of the partnership focuses on deploying AI agents capable of handling complex, multi-step analysis, powered by Claude's advanced reasoning and Snowflake's governed data and AI environment. Business users can ask questions in plain English. Claude figures out what data is needed, pulls it from across the company's Snowflake environment, and delivers the answer, withgreater than 90% accuracyon complex text-to-SQL tasks based on Snowflake's internal benchmarks. By combining Claude's reasoning capabilities with Snowflake's governed data environment, customers in regulated industries like financial services, healthcare, and life sciences can move from pilots to production with confidence. &quot;Enterprises have spent years building secure, trusted data environments, and now they want AI that can work within those environments without compromise,&quot;said Dario Amodei, CEO and Co-Founder of Anthropic. &quot;This partnership brings Claude directly into Snowflake, where that data already lives. It's a meaningful step toward making frontier AI genuinely useful for businesses.&quot; &quot;Snowflake's most strategic partnerships are measured not just in scale, but in the depth of innovation and customer value that we can create together,&quot;said Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of Snowflake. &quot;Anthropic joins a very select group of partners where we have nine-figure alignment, co-innovation at the product level, and a proven track record of executing together for customers worldwide. Together, the combined power of Claude and Snowflake is raising the bar for how enterprises deploy scalable, context-aware AI on top of their most critical business data.&quot; By bringing Claude directly to enterprise data in Snowflake, customers can gain insights from both structured and unstructured data, while maintaining rigorous security standards. Key benefits of the partnership include: By combining Claude's reasoning capabilities with Snowflake's governed data and AI environment, customers across any industry can deploy agents that understand extensive context across customer data—and show their work rather than just retrieve an answer. For example,Simon Data, a composable customer data platform provider,uses Claude on Snowflaketo uncover previously hidden patterns and relationships in their data while maintaining strict governance standards. Intercom, which builds AI-first customer service software, uses Claude through Snowflake Cortex AI to power its Fin AI Agent. &quot;This has transformed how we work with our customers to achieve increased Fin AI Agent automation rates for their support volume,&quot;said Dave Lynch, VP Engineering at Intercom. &quot;Our engagements, especially with our biggest, most demanding customers, are holistically more efficient and more effective. We can do things we simply could not feasibly do before.&quot; A wealth management firm can use Snowflake Intelligence, powered by Claude, to create an agent that synthesizes client holdings with relevant market data and compliance rules to generate personalized portfolio recommendations—all within the security and governance perimeter of Snowflake's AI Data Cloud. Customers can get started with Claude on Snowflake through thisquickstart guide. Enterprises can visit ourEnterprise pageto learn more about deploying Claude. Claude is the only frontier model available on all three of the world's most prominent cloud services, including Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, and Microsoft Azure.

      <title>Anthropic acquires Bun as Claude Code reaches $1B milestone</title>
      <link>https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone</link>
      <description>Claude is the world’s smartest and most capable AI model for developers, startups, and enterprises. Claude Code represents a new era of agentic coding, fundamentally changing how teams build software. In November, Claude Code achieved a significant milestone: just six months after becoming available to the public, it reached $1 billion in run-rate revenue. And today we’re announcing that Anthropic is acquiringBun—a breakthrough JavaScript runtime—to further accelerate Claude Code.  Bun is redefining speed and performance for modern software engineering and development. Founded by Jarred Sumner in 2021, Bun is dramatically faster than the leading competition. As an all-in-one toolkit—combining runtime, package manager, bundler, and test runner—it's become essential infrastructure for AI-led software engineering, helping developers build and test applications at unprecedented velocity.  Bun has improved the JavaScript and TypeScript developer experience by optimizing for reliability, speed, and delight. For those using Claude Code, this acquisition means faster performance, improved stability, and new capabilities. Together, we’ll keep making Bun the best JavaScript runtime for all developers, while building even better workflows into Claude Code.  Since becoming generally available in May 2025, Claude Code has grown from its origins as an internal engineering experiment into a critical tool for many of the world’s category-leading enterprises, including Netflix, Spotify, KPMG, L’Oreal, and Salesforce—and Bun has been key in helping scale its infrastructure throughout that evolution. We’ve been a close partner of Bun for many months. Our collaboration has been central to the rapid execution of the Claude Code team, and it directly drove the recent launch of Claude Code’snative installer. We know the Bun team is building from the same vantage point that we do at Anthropic, with a focus on rethinking the developer experience and building innovative, useful products.  &quot;Bun represents exactly the kind of technical excellence we want to bring into Anthropic,&quot; said Mike Krieger, Chief Product Officer of Anthropic. &quot;Jarred and his team rethought the entire JavaScript toolchain from first principles while remaining focused on real use cases. Claude Code reached $1 billion in run-rate revenue in only 6 months, and bringing the Bun team into Anthropic means we can build the infrastructure to compound that momentum and keep pace with the exponential growth in AI adoption.&quot;  As developers increasingly build with AI, the underlying infrastructure matters more than ever—and Bun has emerged as an essential tool. Bun gets more than 7 million monthly downloads, has earned over 82,000 stars on GitHub, and has been adopted by companies like Midjourney and Lovable to increase speed and productivity.  The decision to acquire Bun is in line with our strategic, disciplined approach to acquisitions: we will continue to pursue opportunities that bolster our technical excellence, reinforce our strength as the leader in enterprise AI, and most importantly, align with our principles and mission.  Bun will be instrumental in helping us build the infrastructure for the next generation of software. Together, we will continue to make Claude the platform of choice for coders and anyone who relies on AI for important work. Bun will remain open source and MIT-licensed, and we will continue to invest in making it the runtime, bundler, package manager, and test runner of choice for JavaScript and TypeScript developers.

      <title>Anthropic partners with Rwandan Government and ALX to bring AI education to hundreds of thousands of learners across Africa</title>
      <link>https://www.anthropic.com/news/rwandan-government-partnership-ai-education</link>
      <description>Anthropic is announcing a new partnership with the Government of Rwanda and African tech training provider ALX to bring Chidi—a learning companion built on Claude—to hundreds of thousands of learners across Africa. Rwanda's ICT &amp; Innovation and Education ministries are deploying Chidi within their national education system, while ALX will bring the tool to students across the continent through their technology training programs. With this initiative, university graduates and young professionals in countries across Africa will be able to use Chidi to learn new skills, like data analytics or cloud computing. And teachers in Rwanda can use it to plan lessons and help them support their students. This partnership represents one of the largest AI for education deployments on the continent, uniting ALX's commitment to empowering African talent, Anthropic's vision for accessible and responsible AI, and Rwanda's Vision 2050 to build an AI-ready workforce and accelerate digital transformation across Rwanda. Through this initiative, the Rwandan government will bring AI tools directly into the national education system. The government will enable AI training for up to 2,000 teachers, as well as a group of civil servants across the country, who will learn to integrate AI into their classroom practice. This training will give them hands-on experience using Claude to support how they teach, plan lessons, and improve their productivity day-to-day. Graduates of the Rwanda pilot will receive a year of access to Claude tools, such as Claude Pro for individuals and Claude Code for developer teams in government, while exploring Claude for Education with university educators, ensuring that this new literacy in AI continues to shape classrooms and the workplace long after the program ends. The Rwandan government sees this initiative as central to their Vision 2050 strategy. As Rwandans begin learning how to use AI, they will help advance the government's goal of building a knowledge economy—launching startups that solve local challenges, joining global companies that need their skills, and creating innovations that reshape industries. “Rwanda’s Vision 2050 places youth and technology at the core of national progress, and our goal is to build a workforce equipped for the opportunities of the 21st century,” said Paula Ingabire, Minister of ICT &amp; Innovation in Rwanda. “This collaboration allows us to explore innovative AI tools that could enhance learning, support educators, strengthen developer capabilities, and provide new forms of digital assistance across selected institutions. These areas remain under review, and by beginning capacity building for civil servants, we ensure our workforce gains the foundational skills to engage with emerging technologies responsibly.” &quot;Rwanda's comprehensive approach to embracing and integrating AI—training teachers, involving policymakers, and building a dedicated working group—creates the foundation for responsible AI deployment,” said Elizabeth Kelly, Head of Beneficial Deployments at Anthropic. “By working with the government and ALX, we're learning how to ensure AI serves local educational needs while reaching students at scale.&quot; Beyond Rwanda, ALX is deploying Chidi across its technology training programs throughout Africa. As one of the continent's largest technology training providers, ALX reaches over 200,000 students and young professionals. Through this partnership, all of their students will access Claude through Chidi, which will serve as a &quot;Socratic mentor&quot;—guiding learners through thoughtful questions, rather than providing direct answers. This approach helps students develop independent problem-solving skills while learning to work effectively with AI tools. Early results demonstrate Chidi's potential impact: since the tool was rolled out on November 4, learners have engaged in over 1,100 conversations and nearly 4,000 learning sessions, with nine out of ten users reporting positive experiences. Chidi is helping students work through complex coding challenges, understand data science concepts, and develop their problem-solving skills. &quot;This is not just about bringing technology to Africa; it's about co-creating the future of learning to unlock the continent's full potential,&quot; said Fred Swaniker, Founder and CEO of ALX. &quot;Chidi transforms how our students build their capabilities, their confidence, and ultimately their careers. As they master AI-powered learning today, they become the architects of Africa's technology-driven future tomorrow.&quot; Today’s announcement represents a new milestone in Anthropic's commitment to ensuring AI works for the public good by reaching students globally. It builds upon our focus on education partnerships that reshape how students and educators interact with AI worldwide. InIceland, we recently launched one of the world's first comprehensive national AI education pilots with the Ministry of Education and Children, giving teachers across the nation access to Claude to transform lesson preparation and student support. TheLondon School of Economicshas provided all students with access to Claude for Education, helping them develop critical thinking skills. And our expanded presence inIndia, where we're opening an office in Bengaluru, focuses on supporting the country's rapidly growing developer and startup ecosystem. These partnerships demonstrate a consistent approach to working closely with governments, educational institutions, and technology companies to ensure AI expands opportunity and serves the communities where it's deployed. We look forward to learning from these deployments, sharing what we've learned with the wider community, and continuing to support educators and learners as they shape AI's role in building our future.</description>
